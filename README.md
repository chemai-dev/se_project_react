![screen-shot](./src/assets/project-screenshot.png)

### Overview

Project-React is the frontend for the full-stack “WTWR — What To Wear?” application. WTWR helps users decide what clothing to wear based on real-time weather data. This version of the app will fetch weather info from a Weather API and automatically recommend suitable clothing items.

This project focuses on building the React-based frontend, applying core concepts such as components, props, state management, hooks, and modular architecture. It also lays the foundation for future backend integration.

### Tools & Technologies

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- Responsive Design
- OpenWeather API Integration
